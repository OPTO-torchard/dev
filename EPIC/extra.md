## Ignition EDGE

Software developed by Inductive Automation.<br>
Built-in drivers to other PLCs: Allen-Bradle, Seimens, Modbus, SNAP PAC, and groov EPIC compatibility.<br>
Cirus Link MQTT Sparkplug specification.<br>

### MQTT Sparkplug

Rather than having a tightly-coupled architecture, have a message-broker architecture with a bi-directional publish-subscribe model. Reduces reliance on IT.
* Simplicity: Build from the edge out, publish-subscribe model makes adding new elements straightforward.<br>
* Security: Everything is securely encrypted, a single centralized  place to manage security profiles; the broker.<br>
* Performance: Efficient payloads, minimal overhead, publish on change only, persistent connections.<br>
    With sparkplug you know the state of all tags in the system at all times.

## Node-RED

Ideal for quickly developing IoT applications, Node-RED is a browser-based flow programming environment originally developed by IBM Emerging Technology Services. It is now open-source and has incredible stock features, with the option to import external Node packages â€” including officially supported PAC and _groov_ nodes. You can use Node-RED on the EPIC processor itself, or access your PAC control tags and _groov_ view tags from another system running Node-RED, for example; a windows or linux computer, the _groov_ Edge Appliance, even from lightweight computers like the Raspberry Pi.<br>
It is both the runtime and editor, ultimately compiling to Javascript. Of particular interest to developers is the function node, which exposes a block of Javascript to the programmer to freely enter raw code that will run in the flow right there on the device.<br>

## Python for REST API

To make RESTful requests with Python requests you need to:

1. `sudo apt-get update`

    Do **NOT** apt-get upgrade!
2. `sudo apt-get install python-pip`

    Do **NOT** upgrade pip individually either!
3. `sudo pip install requests`

4. `import requests`

    Import the library to your script once it is installed
